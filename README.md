# Audio2Face-3D Microservice

NVIDIA Audio2Face-3D NIM (A2F-3D NIM) is delivering generative AI avatar animation solutions based on audio and emotion inputs.

The Audio2Face-3D Microservice converts speech into facial animation in the form of
[ARKit Blendshapes](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit). The facial animation includes emotional
expression. Where emotions can be detected, the facial animation system captures key poses and shapes to replicate
character facial performance by automatically detecting emotions in the input audio. Additionally emotions can be
directly specified as part of the input to the microservice. A rendering engine can consume Blendshape topology to
display a 3D avatar's performance.
